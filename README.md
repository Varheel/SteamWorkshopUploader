# SteamWorkshopUploader
This is a tool that uploads mods for GZDoom games to the Steam Workshop. With a few changes, it could be used for other games too.

The main version targets .NET 5 and uses [Facepunch.Steamworks](https://github.com/Facepunch/Facepunch.Steamworks).

The "Legacy" version targets .NET Framework 3.5 and uses [Steamworks.NET](https://github.com/rlabrecque/Steamworks.NET) (modified to also target 3.5).
